# 👋 Hi, I’m Ariela

💻 **Software Engineer** | 🌱 **Exploring Computational Biology & Scientific Software**  

I build tools at the intersection of **software, health, and science** — with a focus on **accessibility, reproducibility, and clarity**.  
Currently documenting my pivot into **computational biology** through a self-directed curriculum in:  
- Math & Physics  
- Computer Science & Python  
- Biology & Chemistry  
- Bioinformatics & Computational Biology  
- Quantum Foundations & High-Performance Computing  

---

## 🔬 Featured Work
- **[Public Health Cohort Explorer](#)** → interactive dashboard for health datasets with reproducible exports  
- **[Lab Equipment Reservation Tracker](#)** → conflict-safe scheduling system for shared lab instruments  
- **[Sample & Reagent Inventory System](#)** → lot-level tracking and audit logs for lab supplies  

*(More projects coming as I progress through my curriculum 🚀)*
